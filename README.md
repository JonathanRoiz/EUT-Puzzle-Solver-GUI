## Puzzle explanations 
- Puzzle #1:
A table presents set of random 25 numbers in range from 1 to 200 ordered randomly,
the goal is to go through them in ascending order.

- Puzzle #2:
Same as Puzzle #1, but numbers are masked behind their shifted counterparts on default desktop keyboard layout, so
!=1, @=2, #=3, $=4, %=5, ^=6, &=7, *=8, (=9, )=0.

- Puzzle #3:
A table of 25 random numbers need to be translated from the base in () to base10 then pressed on from lowest to highest.

- Puzzle #4:
We are greeted with 25 "?" signs, hovering above which reveals a formula or an evil question that needs to be solved.
Upon solving each of them you have to press on the answers from lowest to highest
(Thankfully, if you do a mistake a solved equation won't become unsolved).
